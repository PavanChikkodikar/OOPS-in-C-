 /* Polymorphism Part- 2 (Function Overriding)*/
 //2) Runtime Polymorphism â€“ This is also known as dynamic (or late) binding.
//in this there are same function display() but the only difference is it has been used in different classes this is called Function Overriding 
//OR
//child class has same function name as that of parent and no arguments
