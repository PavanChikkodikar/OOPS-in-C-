//Friend Class can access private and protected members of other class in which it is declared as friend.  

//simply friend function tells us that using another class we can access both private members and protected members of another class

// If class A is a friend of B, then B doesnâ€™t become a friend of A automatically.
// Friendship is not inherited 
// The concept of friends is not there in Java.
