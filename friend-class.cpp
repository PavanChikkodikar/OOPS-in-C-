//Friend Class  can access private and protected members of other class in which it is declared as friend.  

//simply friend function tells us that using another class we can access the private members of another class

/*Following are some important points about friend functions and classes: 
1) Friends should be used only for limited purpose. too many functions or external classes are declared as friends of a class with protected or private data, it lessens the value of encapsulation of separate classes in object-oriented programming.
2) Friendship is not mutual. If class A is a friend of B, then B doesnâ€™t become a friend of A automatically.
3) Friendship is not inherited 
4) The concept of friends is not there in Java. */
